# 📧 Spam Email Detection System

An advanced Machine Learning application built with **Python** and **Streamlit** to detect spam emails using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Spam emails pose a significant cybersecurity challenge. This project leverages the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** algorithm combined with **TF-IDF Vectorization** to classify emails as:

- **Spam**
- **Ham (Safe)**

The model achieves high accuracy through training on a large dataset of labeled messages.

## ✨ Features

- **Real-time Classification** – Instant results for any email text
- **Visual Analytics** – Confusion Matrix and Dataset Distribution charts
- **High Performance** – Optimized with Streamlit caching
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Clean, interactive web GUI
- **Easy Execution** – Windows `.bat` launcher included

## 🧪 Examples

**Spam (Phishing):**
> Dear Valued Customer, We've detected unusual activity on your Amazon account...

**Ham (Safe):**
> Hi Team, Just a reminder about our weekly project sync on Monday...
